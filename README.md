# Project Gallery
Project gallery project for Founders and Coders application

## About this project: 
This project is about using flexbox to style cards showing all the work I've done to in preperation for this application.
Flexbox is a powerful tool for placing and spacing elements on a page. It's also a great tool for responsive design. 
<br>
Some highlights:

```flex-wrap: wrap```
<br>
Let's you force items in a row onto a new row when they won't all fit in one. 
<br><br>
```flex-direction: column; ```
<br>
This switches the flex direction to a column instead a row. It's how I achieved my one column design for this site's mobile version.
<br><br> 
```align-items: center;```
<br><br>
When the flex-direction is set to row this a simple way to vertically center a block level elements. 

## Making it harder for myself:

I actually did this project last as I was already familiar and comfortable and wanted to initially dedicate time to the other projects in this application.
By the time I got to it I decided I wanted more JavaScript practice so I created and inserted all the elements, besides the main flex container, in my js file. 
This helped me solidify all DOM manipulation learing I did with js, especially from the Movie Data project. For a future challenge would like to access all the data I stored 
in the object directly instead of converting like into an array as I did in both projects.
